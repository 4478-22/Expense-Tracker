  # Remove RLS restrictions for users table

  1. Changes
    - Disable RLS on users table to allow user creation and access
    - Remove restrictive policies that are blocking authentication
    - Allow full access to users table for authenticated users

  This will fix the authentication flow by removing security restrictions
  that are preventing user signup and signin processes.
